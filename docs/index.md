# NAICS Hyperbolic Embedding System

This documentation describes the complete hyperbolic representation
learning system for the NAICS taxonomy. The system integrates:

- Multi-channel transformer-based text encoding  
- Mixture-of-Experts fusion  
- Lorentz-model hyperbolic contrastive learning  
- False-negative mitigation via curriculum clustering  
- Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional refinement (HGCN)
